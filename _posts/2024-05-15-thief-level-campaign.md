A personal project to create levels for Thief: The Dark Project, an immersive sim and first-person stealth title from 1998. Primarily as an exercise in level design, the levels focus on testing veteran players and utilizing the full breadth of Thief's mechanics. Currently an early work in progress.

While the Dark Engine, and by extension the DromEd level editor, is quite outdated by modern standards the actual process of level creation is quite efficient once the initial learning curve is surpased. Most interestingly, the primary form of creating space in DromEd is by carving out pockets of air from an infinite solid with basic primative brushes as opposed to most other level editors creating solid space in an infinite void (often using more complex brushes or full meshes). This does create the restriction that "off-grid" brushwork is more difficult, and less precise, due to having to individually place and rotate primitives to create it.
## Design Philosophy

One of the most important aspects of designing levels for Thief is consideration for the physicality of the environment. Not only is a physically grounded enviroment easier for the player to understand and navigate, but it also enables the player to make logical decisions based on the assumption that the world follows that physicality. For example, the player can reasonably expect a room behind every door, and that the visible exterior of a structure roughly outlines its interior scale. The core gameplay of Thief levels is built around the playeer carefully examining and interacting with their environment, and by creating a natural and cohesive play area, the player is more able to fully express themselves through gameplay.
