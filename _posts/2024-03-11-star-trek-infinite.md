Working closely with Paramount and Paradox Interactive during my time at Nimble Giant Entertainment, we created a new 4X strategy game with the Star Trek IP. The game at its core is based on Stellaris and its host of mechanics. The primary goal was to create a more approachable form of the 4X strategy game by simplifying mechanics and cutting down of extraneous systems while keeping true to the Star Trek setting.
## Edicts

The first system I took ownership of during the project. In an effort to simplify the system compared to Stellaris, Edicts were made to not have any direct resource costs associated with them, and have no limit on active duration. Edicts were instead balanced around a hard limit of how many could be active at a time, and by situational drawbacks. This allowed for more casual players to choose bonuses that applied very broadly and then leave them alone, while also permitting hardcore players to carefully balance the bonuses and drawbacks for fine-tuned economies.
## Planetary Decisions

A system under my sole ownership, Planetary Decisions allow for the optimization of individual planets in your empire, at the cost of resources. The primary goal was the tie them with the Planetary Designations system, adding more allowing the player to make more specialized planets and simultaneously reducing the number of options visible at the same time to not overwhelm the player. Planetary Decisions were designed to be highly impactful, but situational options for the player that enhanced the individual planet identities.

Much of the balancing was structured around forcing the player to make direct trade-off choices for their planet's economy, and making them commit with notable resource costs. Players choosing carelessly found themselves with fractured or highly fragile economies, while players making careful and well-timed choices would be rewarded.
## Tooltips

Every tooltip in Star Trek Infinite had to, at one point or another, go through me.

4X strategy titles have a consistent issue that I wanted to address: Players eventually will fatigue from reading text, and will start to ignore what may be incredibly important informaton.

My solution, create a strict colour and icon language that allowed players to instantly comprehend what any action taken (event choice, building, unit action, etc.) would do with effectively no reading required. The methodology was so simple it bordered on the absurd, I would feed random tooltips into a script that would display them heavily blurred so all that was immediately visible was the colours, general shape of the text, and the vague shape and colour of icons. Despite how stupid it felt to squint at blurry tooltips, it allowed me to create a strict colour language and structure for tooltips that was shared universally in the title. By using the physical shape and form of the text to denote effects (such as over-time effects, versus immediate effects, versus effects that give X resource per Y worker) playtesters were able to understand the effects of their actions effectively without reading any text. This likely would not have been nearly as successful without the wonderfully distinct icons from the UI/UX team.

Further information, such as descriptions of mechanical systems and how they functioned, were stored in “nested tooltips” that could be displayed by mousing over certain text. These nested tooltips could also contain other nested tooltips, ad infinitum. It worked ideally for systems that had no direct player-facing tooltips, but also needed to be explained mid-gameplay (such as crime, planetary stability, or resources).
## Narrative Content

Throughout the project I handled many narrative content pieces, primarily within events and anomalies. In keeping in line with the "Star Trek" fantasy, events were structured like Star Trek episodes, using a single core intrigue or moral dilemma as the initial hook and providing the player with choices that allow them to explore the event in a way that reflects their chosen faction (such as the United Federation having more "compassionate" event options than the other major factions). Players responded quite positively to feeling that they were, by way of event text boxes, playing out Star Trek episodes and enjoyed the choices that were unique to each major faction.

In effort to maintain balance, and decrease scope, some events have choices that while unique between major factions are functionally identical. Despite this, players responded positively to what was merely a small change in flavour text. Players, in general, wanted to feel that their chosen major faction was directly represented in a way that played into the Star Trek fantasy.
