Working closely with Paramount and Paradox Interactive during my time at Nimble Giant Entertainment, we created a new 4X strategy game with the Star Trek IP. The game at its core is based on Stellaris and its host of mechanics. The primary goal was to create a more approachable form of the 4X strategy game by simplifying mechanics and cutting down of extraneous systems while keeping true to the Star Trek setting.
## Edicts

The first system I took ownership of during the project. In an effort to simplify the system compared to Stellaris, Edicts were made to not have any direct resource costs associated with them, and have no limit on active duration. Edicts were instead balanced around a hard limit of how many could be active at a time, and by situational drawbacks. This allowed for more casual players to choose bonuses that applied very broadly and then leave them alone, while also permitting hardcore players to carefully balance the bonuses and drawbacks for fine-tuned economies.
## Planetary Decisions

A system under my sole ownership, Planetary Decisions allow for the optimization of individual planets in your empire, at the cost of resources. The primary goal was the tie them with the Planetary Designations system, adding more allowing the player to make more specialized planets and simultaneously reducing the number of options visible at the same time to not overwhelm the player. Planetary Decisions were designed to be highly impactful, but situational options for the player that enhanced the individual planet identities.
## Tooltips

Every (English-language) tooltip in Star Trek Infinite had to, at one point or another, go through me. Editing, or at times rewriting, the tooltips for the sake of mechanical clarity and ease of understanding to lighten the mental burden of 4X titles and their monstrous amounts of player facing text. Each tooltip should be comprehensible by only reading a few words. Or even no words at all. To achieve this, establishing of a strict colour language was used, as well as heavy use of in-text icons.

Further information, such as descriptions of mechanical systems and how they functioned, were stored in “nested tooltips” that could be displayed by mousing over certain text. These nested tooltips could also contain other nested tooltips, ad infinitum. It worked ideally for systems that had no direct player-facing tooltips, but also needed to be explained mid-gameplay (such as crime, planetary stability, or resources).
